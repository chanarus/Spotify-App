# Spotify-App

This is a sample app to search spotify tracks. For this I have used react client and the provided auth server from the spotify.
Used axios to call the api.
Used the spotify provided sample app to get the access token from the api
For the react app, used the create-react-app cli to initialize the project.

## Setup the project

- Clone the project from the repository
- Run 'npm run dev-install' to install all the dependencies in both client and auth server
- Run 'npm run dev' start both servers.
